# Java Tasks Overview

This repository contains Java files that implement various functionalities including working with ArrayLists, sorting algorithms, and search algorithms.

## ArrayLists.java

### Album Class
The `Album` class defines the structure for representing an album, including its name, number of songs, and artist. It provides the necessary constructors, getter and setter methods, and a `toString()` method.

### ArrayList Operations
- Initializes and populates `albums1` with albums and sorts them based on the number of songs.
- Swaps elements in `albums1` at specific positions.
- Creates and manipulates `albums2` by adding albums from `albums1`, copying all elements, adding new albums, and sorting them alphabetically.
- Searches for a specific album in `albums2`.

## BubbleSort.java

### Bubble Sort Implementation
The `BubbleSort` class implements the Bubble Sort algorithm to sort an ArrayList of strings in ascending order.

## SortSearch.java

### Sort and Search Operations
- Implements the Insertion Sort algorithm to sort an array of integers.
- Uses the Binary Search algorithm to search for the number 9 in the sorted array.
- Provides a comment suggesting the use of a Linear Search algorithm and its relevance.

## Searching Algorithms and Their Use
The tasks in `SortSearch.java` provide insight into the application of various searching algorithms like Binary Search and Linear Search, emphasizing their relevance in real-world scenarios based on the data and sorting requirements.

Feel free to explore each Java file for a detailed understanding of the implemented functionalities and algorithms.
