	* linearSearch() performs a linear search on the code it iterates through the array
	* sequentially from start to finish to test every element to see if it matches the target value 
 */
/*
 * 1. Which searching algorithm would be appropriate to use on the given list?
 * Binary Search
 * 2. Why was this algorithm a good choice?
 * Binary Search required the list to be sorted, the given list was already sorted
 * in ascending order. Binary Search has a time complexity of O(log n) which makes it 
 * efficient for large data sets.
 * 3. Where would you use this algorithm in the real world?
 * Searching for a specific word in a dictionary.
 * Searching for an item in a sorted database table.
 * Auto-complete function for text editors.
 * Searching for a specific date or time in a schedule.
